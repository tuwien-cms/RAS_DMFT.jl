# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are always welcome.

## Formatting

- Julia code: format with [Runic](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Runic.jl):
  `runic --check .` reports, `runic -i .` rewrites.
  Keep lines under ~92 characters.
- Markdown: format with [Prettier](https://prettier.io):
  `prettier --write "**/*.md"`.
  Keep lines under ~100 characters.
- URLs, LaTeX, code blocks, tables, and hardcoded numbers in tests
  may exceed both limits when longer lines read better.
- Break Markdown lines at logical locations,
  such as commas, brackets, or the end of a sentence,
  and start every sentence on a new line.
  Prettier does not check this,
  as `proseWrap` keeps its default `preserve`,
  which is also why it must never be set to `always`.

## Naming

- Struct fields stay ASCII (`e_v`, `t_v`).
- Function arguments may use Unicode (`ϵ_imp`, `ϵ_mf`, `Δ`).
- Greek epsilon is U+03F5 `ϵ` (`\epsilon`),
  never U+03B5 `ε` (`\varepsilon`).
- Use the ASCII hyphen `-` in comments and docstrings,
  never U+2212 `−` or U+2013 `–`.

## Error messages

- Wrap an error message that interpolates a value in
  [`lazy"..."`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/strings/#Base.LazyString):

  ```julia
  function check_positive(x::Int)
      x >= 0 || throw(ArgumentError(lazy"message $(x)"))
      return x
  end
  ```

- A message without interpolation stays a plain string literal,
  where `lazy"..."` would only add noise.

## Testing

Run the test suite from the repository root with

```sh
julia --project=. --eval 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```

- A new feature comes with its tests.
- A bug fix comes with a test that fails on the unfixed version.
- Prefer hardcoded expected values over comparing a function to itself.
- Set a tolerance on random data by rounding the worst deviation you measure up,
  otherwise the test goes flaky on another machine.

## Commits

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  The git history has examples.
- The scope is optional and names the area a change is restricted to,
  whatever the type,
  as in `docs(Poles)` or `test(Combinatorics)`:
  - `Poles`
  - `Combinatorics`

  Leave it out as soon as the change reaches beyond one of them,
  as most of the history does.

- Keep one logical change per commit.
- Write the header only.
  Add a body when the diff alone would mislead,
  such as a breaking change,
  a non-obvious physics or numerics reason,
  or a fix whose cause is not visible in the changed lines.

## CHANGELOG

- Only user-visible changes get an entry.
  A refactor, a test, or a comment does not.
- Open the pull request first.
  Then add the entries in a trailing `chore: update CHANGELOG` commit
  and push again.
  The PR number does not exist before that,
  and a commit cannot contain its own hash.
- Cite both, as
  `([#NNN](https://github.com/tuwien-cms/RAS_DMFT.jl/pull/NNN)) (short hash)`.
- One PR contributes as many entries as it has changes.
  Each cites the commit that made its statement true.
